NAME
	Bashpress

SYNOPSIS
	<bashpress>/bin/new <title>
	<bashpress>/bin/publish [-c] <path>

DESCRIPTION
	Bashpress is a rebellion against browser-based blogging engines,
	WYSIWYG editors, and relational databases.  It is command-line only,
	has no user accounts, and doesn't use a database.  It loves Smarty.

		-c	This option, available to bin/publish and bin/republish
			will disable commenting no matter the default state.

INSTALLATION
	Download or checkout Bashpress.  Use the included httpd.conf file to
	setup a VirtualHost rooted at <bashpress>/public.  Create
	<bashpress>/.templates and make it writable by the webserver.

	Modify the PHP include_path variable, defined in httpd.conf, to point
	to your Bashpress and Smarty installations.

	Modify <bashpress>/include/config.php to setup basic site and feed
	parameters, especially your site's Fully Qualified Domain Name.
	(Since Bashpress contains PHP code run outside of the webserver SAPI,
	this variable must be provided by the user.)

DEPENDENCIES
	PHP <http://php.net/>
	Smarty <http://smarty.net/>
