NAME
	Bashpress

SYNOPSIS
	<bashpress>/bin/new <title>
	<bashpress>/bin/publish <path>

DESCRIPTION
	Bashpress is a rebellion against browser-based blogging engines,
	WYSIWYG editors, and relational databases.  It is command-line only,
	has no user accounts, and doesn't use a database.  It loves Smarty [1].

INSTALLATION
	Download or checkout Bashpress.  Use the included httpd.conf file to
	setup a VirtualHost rooted at <bashpress>/public.  Create and make
	writable by the webserver <bashpress>/.templates.

	Modify the PHP include_path variable, defined in httpd.conf, to point
	to your Bashpress and Smarty installations.

DEPENDENCIES
	PHP <http://php.net/>
	Smarty <http://smarty.net/>
